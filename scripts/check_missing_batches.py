"""Check which batches are missing today for the heartbeat workflow.

The set of batches that are *expected* to be done depends on when the check
runs:
  - 午检 (midday, before ~15:00 CST): only `morning` must be done.
    `noon` may still be running and `evening` has not started yet, so they
    must NOT be treated as missing.
  - 终检 (final, ~22:17 CST): all three batches should be done.

Pass the expected set via the EXPECTED env var (space-separated). Defaults to
all three for backwards compatibility.
